# Traffic-Light
 A Kotlin-based traffic light simulation designed to mimic the complex intersection of Saarbr√ºcken. The project includes:      4 vehicle traffic lights     8 pedestrian traffic lights     4 ultrasonic sensors to detect movement.  Each traffic light uses three LEDs (red, yellow, green) for intuitive visualization. The system is modeled to simulate real-world traffic scenarios and is intended for use in an Android app.
