# Traffic-Light
#  Kotlin & Jetpack Compose

This project simulates a busy intersection in Saarbr√ºcken using Kotlin. The simulation includes multiple traffic lights and ultrasonic sensors to manage traffic and pedestrian flow.  

## Features  
- **Traffic Lights:**  
  - 4 for vehicles.  
  - 8 for pedestrians.  
  - Each with red, yellow, and green LEDs for clear visibility.  
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:**  
  - 4 sensors to detect pedestrian or vehicle movement.  

## Goal  
The primary goal is to develop an Android app that visually represents the traffic system and allows users to observe and interact with the simulation.  

## Technologies  
- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **Framework:** Gradle  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add a user interface to configure traffic light timing.  
- Implement AI to optimize traffic flow based on sensor data.  

## Getting Started  
Clone this repository and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. Follow the build instructions to deploy the app to your Android device.
