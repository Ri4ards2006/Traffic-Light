This example demonstrates how to use the ExtendedTouchEvent library, especially usage of the
different methods for registering callbacks for event handling.

It uses a 2.4" TFT display (with an ILI9341 controller) with resistive touch screen (XPT2046) and Adafruit GFX 
as graphic library and XPT2046_Touchscreen for accessing the touchpanel.

The module is used together with an ESP32 but any other arduino compatible processor should work.

For the used pins see definitions in the code (**don't forget to to check whether they fit to your board**)
